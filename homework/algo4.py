# Scenario 3: Secret Palindrome Message Checker (with Sentences)

# A group of friends is hiding palindromes in sentences 
# (ignoring punctuation, spacing, and casing). 
# You are building a tool to check if a sentence is a secret palindrome.

# For each sentence:
# (1) Remove spaces
# (2) Remove punctuation
# (3) Convert to lowercase
# (4) Check if it is a palindrome
# (5) Add all the original sentences that is a palindrome to a new list

Challenge 6:
A programmer is writing a program to calculate the 
check digit for a 12-digit integer.

The check digit is calculated by multiplying the digits 
in odd positions by 3 and the digits in even positions by 1. 
These values are added together to produce a total. 
The total is subtracted from the next multiple of 10 to 
give a final value. If the final value is 10, the check digit is X.

Example: 
12-digit integer = 1  0  3  4  5  6  2  7  1  0  1  3
Result           = 3  0  9  4  15 6  6  7  3  0  3  3
Total = 3 + 0 + 9 + 4 + 15 + 6 + 6 +7 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 3 = 59
The next multiple of 10 is 60 (*hint: nextnum = math.ceil(num/10) * 10)
So, check digit = 60 - 59 = 1

(a) The The program code function calculate() takes a 
12-digit number as a parameter. It calculates the 
check digit and returns the check digit.

Write the code for the function calculate [6]

(b) The main program:
•	Takes as input a 12-digit number until a valid 
12-digit integer is entered
•	Calls the function calculate() with the valid input 
as a parameter
•	Outputs the number with the check digit as its 13th digit

Write the code for the main program. [5]

Test that:
103456271013 = 1
123456789012 = 0

Challenge 7:
A developer needs to extract specific characters from a 
given string to generate a user ID.

(a) Write a function generate_user_id(name, birthdate) 
that takes a user's full name as a single string in the 
format "First Last" and a birthdate in the format "YYYYMMDD". 
The function should return a user ID consisting of:

- The first three letters of the last name (in uppercase),
- The last two digits of the year of birth,
- The first letter of the first name (in lowercase).
For example:
generate_user_id("John Doe", "19901225") should return DOE90j.

(b) Write a main program that:

- Takes as input a full name and birthdate,
- Calls the generate_user_id() function,
- Outputs the generated user ID.
Test cases:

generate_user_id("Alice Tan", "20030515") should return TAN03a.
generate_user_id("Michael Johnson", "19850911") should return JOH85m.

Challenge: Credit Card Validation
A financial institution needs to verify the validity of credit card numbers 
using the Luhn algorithm.

Task 1: Implementing the Luhn Algorithm
(a) Write a function is_valid_credit_card(card_number) that takes 
a credit card number as a string and checks if it is valid according 
to the Luhn algorithm. The function should:

- Start from the rightmost digit (check digit) and move left.
- Double every second digit. If the doubling results in a number greater 
    than 9, subtract 9 from it.
- Sum all the digits (including those not doubled).

If the total sum is divisible by 10, return True 
(indicating the card number is valid); otherwise, return False.

Example:

is_valid_credit_card("4539148803436467") should return True.
is_valid_credit_card("1234567812345670") should return False.

Task 2: Testing the Function
(b) Test your function with the following credit card numbers 
and determine if they are valid:
